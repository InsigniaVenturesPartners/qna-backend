a1 = Answer.find_or_create_by(body: "<p><span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">There is no 'right' answer to this question, but usually when one refers to a 'Series A' investment, they are referring to their first institutional round of capital (i.e. from a venture capital firm). Most startups raise a seed or angel round between $25K and $1M. Seed and angel investment are usually made by high net worth individuals.&nbsp;</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Once you've reached certain milestones (ironically, none of them are set in stone) one of two things will happen 1) you'll begin to talk to venture capital firms about making an investment or 2) venture capital firms will begin calling you about making an investment. If you are lucky enough to close on this investment you'll call it your 'Series A'. The next round will be Series B and so on until you file for an IPO or get bought/sold.&nbsp;</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">There is nothing magical about these terms, but they make it easier for everyone to understand your stage.</span></p>", author_id: demo_user.id, question_id: q2.id)
